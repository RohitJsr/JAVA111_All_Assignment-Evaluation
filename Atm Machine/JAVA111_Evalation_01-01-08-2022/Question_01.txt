Q1) Explain why Java is platform-independent ?

Ans:-Yes Java is a Platform independent language.

Let's see why:
Platform independent means the execution of the program is not restricted by the type of operating
a system installed and hence we can execute the java program in any type of environment available.

How:
Java is a platform-independent language because of the magic of java which is bytecode.

In java, when we execute the source code, it generates the .class file which contains the bytecodes.
 Bytecodes are interpreted by JVM which is available with every type of OS we install.

On the other side, the source code written in C or C++ gets converted into an object code which is
 machine and OS dependent and hence are termed as Platform dependent.
